As it states in MAC 0122 the course purpouse is:

"Study, through examples, the concepts of correctness, performance, and design of algorithms and of their basic data structures."

Through "Algorithms that use stacks and queues. [...] linked lists and pointers. 
Recursive algorithms. Search, insertion, and deletion in arrays and linked lists.
Binary search. Sorting algorithms (insertion, selection , mergesort, heapsort, quicksort) 
String matching algorithms,Enumeration algorithms,Optimization over sequences. 
Empirical analysis of performance of algorithms."

And the codes present on this develops these to develop the habilities aimed on this course,implemeting the previously cited algorithms.
